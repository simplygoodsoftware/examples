# Bots

Bots are virtual Pyrus users that can be directed to perform tasks or approve forms. 
Each bot has an associated program (a web service) that performs a specific function. 
When a task or form is routed to the bot, Pyrus invokes a call to the web service. 
The bot performs its action and then returns the result to Pyrus. 
Pyrus stores the results in comment or form fields and forwards the task to the next workflow stage (or returns it to a previous stage).
